# Perlin_Noise_Lines
My attempt to produce an animation/demonstration of Perlin Noise in JavaScript.
Perlin noise is a type of gradient noise developed by Ken Perlin in 1983 as a result of his frustration with the "machine-like" look of computer graphics at the time. He formally described his findings in a SIGGRAPH paper in 1985 called An image Synthesizer.
Perlin Noise generates a serise of semi-random outputs in the vicinity of the previous outputs.
